# Tech-Academy-Projects
This repository contains the majority of the assignments and projects I completed as part of my training at the Tech Academy. Many of these programs are simple, basic exercises meant to teach a particular concept, but there are some noteworthy programs that I am proud of as well. This README will highlight the most important files.

AJAX: This folder contains only a simple lesson in using Asynchronous JavaScrict and XML (AJAX) for web development

Basic_C#_Projects: Probably the most robust folder in this repository given the C# and Unity Course was one of my longest, this contains many of the basic C# console applications I made to practice various concepts. The console Blackjack app was the final project for the C# section of the course and is the most complete test of my C# skills.

HTML-CSS_Projects: This folder contains many of my first coding assignments and exercises from the Tech Academy as I learned the fundamentals of web development. In the Project folder are few websites for the Dungeons and Dragons campaign I run. The first complete one is one_page_website.html which was made from scratch using HTML and CSS, while the other website is bootstrap4_project.html, which was made using the Bootstrap libraries.

JavaScript_Projects: This folder contains all of the assignments and exercises I completed for my JavaScript Course at the Tech Academy. The Calculator, TicTacToe, and Pizza_Project folders all contain fairly simple yet functional apps and games that tested the accumulative skills of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

SQL_Projects: The projects and assignments from the Tech Academy's SQL and Database Management Course. These were largely made in Microsoft SQL Server Mangement Studio.
