	<h1 style="color:chocolate"> Northern Ireland </h1>
	<p> Since the 1920s, when Northern Ireland was officially separated from Ireland, 
	it has been tormented by sectarian violence. Notwithstanding the peacemaking efforts that 
	began in earnest in the mid-1990s, Northern Ireland is still best navigated by those who are 
	skilled in the shibboleths and cultural codes that demarcate its peoples, governing which 
	football (soccer) team to cheer for, which whiskey to drink, and which song to sing. 
	The complexity of those political markers is captured in a graffito once scrawled on 
	Belfast walls that read “If you are not confused you don’t understand the situation.”

		<h1> The Republic of Ireland </h1>
			<p style="color:green"> The magnificent scenery of Ireland’s Atlantic coastline faces a 2,000-mile-wide expanse 
		of ocean, and its geographic isolation has helped it to develop a rich heritage of culture and 
		tradition that was linked initially to the Gaelic language. Washed by abundant rain, 
		the country’s pervasive grasslands create a green-hued landscape that is responsible for the 
		popular sobriquet Emerald Isle. Ireland is also renowned for its wealth of folklore, 
		from tales of tiny leprechauns with hidden pots of gold to that of the patron saint, Patrick, 
		with his legendary ridding the island of snakes and his reputed use of the three-leaved 
		shamrock as a symbol for the Christian Trinity.
